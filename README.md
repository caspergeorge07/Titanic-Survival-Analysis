# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
Analysis of factors affecting Titanic survival rates using Python
## Project Overview
This project analyzes factors affecting the survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic. The goal is to explore how variables such as gender, age, ticket class, and fare influenced survival.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `NumPy`: Numerical computing.

## Key Findings
1. **Gender**:
   - Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.
2. **Passenger Class**:
   - Passengers in First Class were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.
3. **Fare**:
   - Higher ticket fares correlated positively with survival.
4. **Age**:
   - Survival was less dependent on age but children had slightly better chances.
5. **Family Size**:
   - Smaller families tended to have better survival chances.

## Visualizations
The repository includes:
- Histograms of age and fare distributions.
- Correlation heatmap of key variables.
- Bar plots showing survival rates by gender and class.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://caspergeorge07/Titanic-Survival-Analysis.git
